# The name of the native library. This is the name which will be used in Python to import the
# library (i.e. `import string_utils`). If you change this, you must also change the name of the
# `#[pymodule]` in `src/lib.rs`.
name = "string_utils"

# "cdylib" is necessary to produce a shared library for Python to import from.
#
# Downstream Rust code (including code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`) will not be able
# to `use string_utils;` unless the "rlib" or "lib" crate type is also included, e.g.:
# crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
